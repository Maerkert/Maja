# Maja - Blood glucose monitoring system for diabetes

Until now, people with diabetes need to read their sensors that measure their blood glucose by hand or with a Freestyle Libre system.
As a result, the user is constantly forced to retrieve the blood glucose value and keep an eye on it by themself. Children and people with disabilities may not be able to interpret the values and draw conclusions from them.
Maja monitors the value continuously and signals the status with LEDs inside of a half transparent tortoise casing. Children and people with disabilities can be more easily taught the topic of diabetes and they are actively involved in the treatment.
